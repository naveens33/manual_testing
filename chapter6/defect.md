## Bug/Defect

### What is a Defect?
- A defect, also known as a bug or an issue, refers to a flaw or error in a software application or system that causes it to behave unexpectedly or not as intended.
- Defects can arise due to mistakes made during the development process, such as coding errors, design flaws, or misinterpretation of requirements.

### Defect Characteristics
- Defects can vary in severity, ranging from minor cosmetic issues to critical problems that result in system crashes or data corruption.
- Common defect types include functional defects (incorrect behavior), performance defects (slow response), and security defects (vulnerabilities).
- Defects can be discovered at different stages of the software development life cycle, such as during coding, testing, or even in production.

### Defect Life Cycle
Defect Life Cycle - Notes

1. New:
- The defect is reported or logged for the first time, usually by a tester, user, or an automated testing tool.
- It is marked as "New" and awaits review and assignment to the appropriate development team.

2. Assigned:
- A team lead or manager reviews the newly reported defect.
- They assign the defect to a specific developer or a team responsible for investigating and fixing the issue.

3. Open:
- The defect is now actively being worked on by the assigned developer.
- It remains in the "Open" state while the developer tries to understand the root cause and devises a solution.

4. Fixed:
- After the developer identifies and implements a solution for the defect, they mark it as "Fixed" in the system.
- The defect is considered resolved from the developer's perspective.

5. Retest:
- The fixed software is made available for testing by the QA team.
- Testers perform testing on the software to verify whether the defect has been successfully resolved.

6. Verified:
- If the tester confirms that the defect is no longer present in the software, they mark it as "Verified" or "Closed."
- The defect is considered closed, and the life cycle ends for this particular issue.

7. Reopen (Optional):
- In some cases, the tester may find that the defect still persists or that the original fix was not sufficient.
- The defect is reopened and sent back to the development team for further investigation and resolution.

8. Duplicate:
- If the reported defect is a duplicate of an existing defect in the system, it is marked as a "Closed Duplicate."
- The original defect, which it duplicates, remains open for resolution.

9. Rejected:
- Sometimes, the development team may determine that the reported issue is not a valid defect or does not require fixing.
- In such cases, the defect is marked as "Rejected."

10. Deferred:
- If a defect is deemed low priority or not critical for the current release, it may be deferred to a future release.
- The defect is marked as "Deferred," and its resolution is postponed. 

11. Closed:
- The "Closed" stage is the final stage of the defect life cycle.
- After the tester verifies that the defect has been successfully fixed and it no longer exists in the software, they mark it as "Closed."

### Defect Management
- Effective defect management is essential for maintaining software quality.
- Defect tracking tools are often used to log, track, and manage defects throughout their life cycle.
- Regular defect analysis helps identify patterns and trends, leading to process improvements in software development.
