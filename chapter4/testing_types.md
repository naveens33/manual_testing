 - Focuses on obtaining feedback from real users in real-world scenarios.
 - Helps identify usability issues, collect user feedback, and validate the software in diverse environments.

## Different types of non-functional testing in software testing:

### 1. Performance Testing:
   - Evaluates the software's performance under various conditions.
   - Test factors such as response time, scalability, throughput, and resource usage.
   - Helps identify performance bottlenecks, load capacity, and system stability.

### 2. Load Testing:
   - Tests the software's performance under expected and peak load conditions.
   - Simulates realistic user loads to assess system behavior and response time.
   - Determines if the software can handle anticipated user volumes and concurrent requests.

### 3. Stress Testing:
   - Tests the software's performance under extreme conditions beyond normal operational limits.
   - Assesses how the system handles excessive loads, high traffic, or resource constraints.
   - Helps identify the breaking point and potential failure areas of the software.

### 4. Security Testing:
   - Tests the software's resilience against security vulnerabilities and threats.
   - Identifies potential security weaknesses, such as unauthorized access or data breaches.
   - Includes tests for authentication, authorization, encryption, and secure communication.

### 5. Usability Testing:
   - Assesses the software's user-friendliness and user experience.
   - Tests the ease of use, navigation, and overall design from the user's perspective.
   - Collects feedback from end-users to improve usability and user satisfaction.

### 6. Compatibility Testing:
   - Tests the software's compatibility with different environments, platforms, and configurations.
   - Verifies functionality across various operating systems, browsers, devices, etc.
   - Ensures consistent performance and behavior across different setups.

### 7. Reliability Testing:
   - Tests the software's ability to perform consistently over a specified period.
   - Assesses the software's stability, availability, and fault tolerance.
   - Measures mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR).

### 8. Scalability Testing:
   - Tests the software's ability to handle increasing workload and user demands.
   - Evaluates how well the system scales with growing data, concurrent users, or transactions.
   - Identifies performance bottlenecks and determines the software's capacity to handle growth.

### 9. Recovery Testing:
   - Tests the software's ability to recover from failures or disruptions.
   - Simulates various failure scenarios and assesses system recovery mechanisms.
   - Verifies data integrity, system restoration, and fault tolerance.

### 10. Localization Testing:
 - Tests the software's adaptability to different languages, cultures, and regional settings.
 - Verifies the correct translation, formatting, and functionality in localized versions.
 - Ensures that the software meets the requirements of specific target markets.

## Other types of testing are,

***1. Ad hoc testing***: Informal and unplanned testing performed without predefined test cases or a specific test plan to explore the software's behavior and identify defects.

***2. Alpha testing:*** Initial testing of a software version conducted by a select group of users or testers in a controlled environment to assess its functionality, performance, and usability.

***3. Black box testing:*** Testing approach where the internal structure or implementation details of the software are not known to the tester, focusing on testing the functionality and behavior from an external perspective.

***4. Configuration testing:*** Testing the software against different hardware, software, and network configurations to ensure compatibility, stability, and optimal performance across various setups.

***5. Dynamic testing:*** Testing approach that involves executing the software and observing its behavior to validate functionality, performance, and other dynamic aspects.

***6. End-to-end testing:*** Testing the entire software system, including all integrated components and dependencies, to simulate real-world scenarios and validate the system's functionality and interactions.

***7. Exhaustive testing:*** A theoretical testing approach that aims to test every possible input and combination to ensure complete coverage, but in practical terms, it is rarely feasible due to the large number of possible combinations.

***8. Exploratory testing:*** Simultaneous learning, testing, and design of test cases without predefined scripts or test cases, allowing testers to explore the software freely and uncover defects.

***9. Gray-box testing:*** Testing approach that combines elements of black box testing and white box testing, where the tester has limited knowledge of the internal structure and implementation details of the software.

***10. Independent testing:*** Testing performed by individuals or teams who are separate from the development team to ensure unbiased evaluation of the software's quality, functionality, and adherence to requirements.

***11. Module testing:*** Testing individual modules or components of the software in isolation to verify their functionality, interactions, and integration readiness.

***12. Negative testing:*** Testing where inputs or conditions that are expected to cause errors or failures are deliberately provided to evaluate how the software handles such scenarios.

***13. Pair testing:*** Testing technique where two individuals collaborate and work together to test the software, with one person acting as the tester and the other as an observer or assistant.

***14. Positive testing:*** Testing where inputs and conditions are intentionally selected to verify that the software functions correctly and produces the expected results.

***15. Re-testing:*** The process of repeating previously executed test cases to verify that defects or issues have been resolved and the software behaves as expected.

***16. Risk-based testing:*** Testing approach that focuses on identifying and prioritizing testing efforts based on the potential risks associated with specific features, functionalities, or areas of the software.

***17. Scalability testing:*** Testing the software's ability to handle increasing workloads, data volumes, or user loads to assess its performance, stability, and capacity to scale.

***18. Session-based testing:*** Testing approach where testing is organized into time-boxed sessions with specific objectives, and the tester records their activities, observations, and defects encountered during each session.

***19. White box testing:*** Testing approach where the internal structure, code, and implementation details of the software are known to the tester, focusing on testing the internal logic, code paths, and coverage.
