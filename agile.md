## Agile Methodology
The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. It involves constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating.

Advantages:
* Continuous customer feedback
* The ability to adapt 
* Faster delivery
* Lower project risk
* Ongoing innovation

## Scrum 
Scrum is a subset of Agile. It is a lightweight process framework for agile development, and the most widely-used one.

## Scrum Members
* Scrum Master
* Product Owner
* Team

## Scrum Events

* Sprint
* Sprint planning
* Daily Scrum
* Sprint review
* Sprint retrospective

## Scrum Artifacts
* Product backlog
* Sprint backlog

## Sprint
Sprint is the time frame in which the actual incremental work must be completed and doesnâ€™t exceed 30 days. The ideal sprint takes two weeks.

## Daily Scrum
The Scrum is a short daily meeting led by the Scrum master, where the team comes to talk about 

* What I have done yesterday
* What I am going to do
* Any impediments

## Sprint retrospective
The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.

During the Sprint Retrospective, the team discusses:

* What went well in the Sprint
* What could be improved
* What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint

## Product backlog
In Agile development, a product backlog is a prioritized list of deliverables (such as new features) that should be implemented as part of a project or product development.
It's a decision-making artifact that helps you estimate, refine, and prioritize everything you might sometime in the future want to complete.

## Sprint backlog
A sprint backlog is a subset of the product backlog and lists the work items to complete in one specific sprint. The purpose of the sprint backlog is to identify items from the product backlog that the team will work on during the sprint. This occurs during the sprint planning process


## When Sprint backlog created
Sprint backlog starts after Sprint planning. Process follows, Product roadmap -> Product backlog -> Sprint planning -> Sprint backlog
